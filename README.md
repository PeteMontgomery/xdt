# xdt

The XML Document Transform language, or XDT, shipped with Visual Studio 2010. Itâ€™s an XML dialect designed to help you automatically transform your .NET config files appropriately for your various deployment environments.

This is a free implementation I wrote in C# - please see the accompanying blog post for a better description.
